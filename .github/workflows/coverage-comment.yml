name: Coverage Comment

# This workflow runs after CI completes and posts coverage comments to PRs.
# It uses workflow_run to run in the upstream repo context with write permissions,
# enabling coverage comments on fork PRs that would otherwise fail due to
# insufficient permissions (see: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/issues/339)
